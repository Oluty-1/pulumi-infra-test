# Architecture Overview

## Infrastructure Design
The infrastructure is designed with a focus on scalability, security, and maintainability. It follows AWS best practices and implements a multi-tier architecture.

## Components Breakdown

### Networking Layer
- **VPC**: 10.0.0.0/16 CIDR block
- **Subnets**: 
  - Public subnets for ALB
  - Private subnets for ECS tasks and RDS
- **NAT Gateway**: For outbound internet access from private subnets
- **VPC Endpoints**: For secure AWS service access

### Compute Layer
- **ECS Cluster**: Fargate-based container orchestration
- **Auto Scaling**: 
  - CPU utilization target: 70%
  - Memory utilization target: 80%
  - Min instances: 1
  - Max instances: 3
- **Load Balancer**: Application Load Balancer with SSL termination

### Data Layer
- **RDS Instance**: 
  - PostgreSQL database
  - Multi-AZ deployment
  - Automated backups
  - Encryption at rest

### Security Layer
- **IAM Roles**: Least privilege access
- **Security Groups**: Restricted network access
- **Secrets Manager**: Secure credentials management

### Monitoring Layer
- **CloudWatch**: 
  - Resource metrics
  - Container logs
  - Custom metrics
- **OpenSearch**: Log analytics and visualization
- **Alerts**: Proactive monitoring and notification

## High Availability
- Resources distributed across multiple Availability Zones
- Auto-scaling for handling traffic spikes
- Multi-AZ database deployment
- Load balancer health checks

## Security Considerations
- Private subnets for sensitive resources
- Security group restrictions
- Encryption in transit and at rest
- Regular automated backups

## Network Flow
1. External traffic enters through ALB
2. ALB routes to ECS tasks in private subnets
3. ECS tasks communicate with RDS in private subnets
4. Outbound internet access via NAT Gateway

## Scaling Strategy
- Horizontal scaling based on:
  - CPU utilization
  - Memory utilization
  - Request count
- Scaling policies with cooldown periods
- Database connection pooling

## Monitoring and Logging
- Centralized logging with CloudWatch
- Custom metrics and dashboards
- Automated alerts for:
  - High CPU/Memory usage
  - Error rate spikes
  - Database connection issues
