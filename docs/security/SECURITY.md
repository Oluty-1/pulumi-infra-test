# Security Documentation

## Security Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in our AWS infrastructure, following the principle of defense in depth and least privilege access.

## Network Security

### VPC and Subnet Design
- VPC with private and public subnets across multiple AZs
- Private subnets for sensitive resources (ECS tasks, RDS)
- Public subnets only for ALB
- NAT Gateway for controlled outbound access

### Security Groups



## Data Security

### Encryption
- RDS encryption at rest using AWS KMS
- Secrets Manager encryption for sensitive data
- SSL/TLS encryption for data in transit
- HTTPS for ALB listeners

### Secrets Management
- Database credentials stored in Secrets Manager
- Application secrets managed through Secrets Manager
- Automatic rotation of secrets enabled
- Access controlled through IAM policies

## Monitoring and Audit

### CloudWatch Logs
- ECS container logs
- RDS logs
- ALB access logs
- VPC Flow Logs

### CloudWatch Alerts
- Failed login attempts
- Unusual API calls
- Resource utilization spikes
- Error rate thresholds

### AWS CloudTrail
- API activity logging
- Resource change tracking
- Security analysis
- Compliance auditing

## Security Best Practices

### Container Security
- Regular container image updates
- Image vulnerability scanning
- No privileged containers
- Read-only root filesystem

### Database Security
- Regular security patches
- Automated backups
- Point-in-time recovery
- Access limited to ECS tasks

### Application Security
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules
- DDoS protection through AWS Shield
- Regular security assessments
- Automated security testing

## Compliance Controls
- Data encryption standards
- Access control policies
- Audit logging
- Backup and recovery procedures
